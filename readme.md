# Hash-Checker

This is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to check the integrity of files and generate hashes. 
It also allows you to scan hashes using the VirusTotal API.

## What is a hash, and what is it for? :

A hash is a fixed-length string generated by a hash function that uniquely represents the contents of a file or data. 
Hashes are commonly used to verify data integrity, ensure files haven't been tampered with, and quickly compare large datasets.
In the context of files, hashing helps confirm that a file remains unchanged or authentic.<br>


## Some uses of hashing :

- **File integrity verification:** Check if files have been altered or corrupted by comparing their hashes before and after transfer or storage.
- **Password storage:** Store hashed versions of passwords to enhance security.
- **Digital signatures:** Verify the authenticity and integrity of digital documents.
- **Duplicate detection:** Identify duplicate files or data by comparing their hashes.
- **Security checks:** Scan hashes against databases (like VirusTotal) to detect malicious or known compromised files.
